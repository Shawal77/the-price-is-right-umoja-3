# PRICE IS RIGHT

In this workshop,we'll design an application that allows a player to guess attributes about a price ie whether its high,low, or medium as set by the deployer. This is alot similar to rock paper scissors in that high beats medium which beats low and the winnner is decide in that order. Also the game continues until there is no draw.
